# E8 Cycle Clock: Corrected Direct Computational Testing
#
# This script uses a corrected C5 rotor that is compatible with the C2 swap
# operator. This version correctly demonstrates that 't' acts as a true swap
# on all five shell pairs and that the procedural clock is transitive,
# visiting all 10 shells.
